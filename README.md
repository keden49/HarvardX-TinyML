# Repository Overview 
This repository reflects my journey through the Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) professional course, offered through a collaboration between Harvard University and edX. This coursework explores the intersection of machine learning and embedded systems, focusing on deploying efficient models like neural networks onto resource-constrained hardware. 
Throughout this projects, I am also strengthening my proficiency in the Python programming language, applying it to implement machine learning algorithms, process data, and build practical TinyML solutions. This dual focus on TinyML concepts and Python development enables me to translate theoretical knowledge into functional code, deepening both my understanding of the course material and my capabilities as a programmer.
